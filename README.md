## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-By carefully studying the interview transcripts containing the conversation between the analysis team and the client.
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
